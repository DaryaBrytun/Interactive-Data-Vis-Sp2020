         Project 2. Life Expectancy in the world in different perspectives. 
         Prospectus 
	On my second project, I would like to continue the topic of Life expectancy (LE). While I was doing the Project 1, I was interested how the LE were changing   during the years by every country, what is the difference between LE for man and for women. So now I want to go deeper to the life expectancy individually and present it in the different perspectives. 
	Analyzing the difference in female and male life expectancy in different regions during the years. Itâ€™s widely known that women live longer than man today. What about in the past? Was it the same century ago? Is it the same tendency in a rich and poor country? To implement his idea, it can help a line graph with dual Y axes (female and male) or a line graph with Y axes for female LE and X axes for male EX.
	I am also thinking about implementing the map, using the US state or World geojson data. I assume it can give a clear illustration the difference of LF between different regions.
	I admit that during the project I can change slightly my direction. Perhaps, I will find some interesting attributes which I want to include to the project.
	There are a lot of different sources with the data for this topic. One of them, which I used on my first project, is https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy.
