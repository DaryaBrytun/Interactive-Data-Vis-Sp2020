        Life expectancy is the key metric for assessing population health.  It tells us the average age of death in a population.

          Estimates suggest that in a pre-modern, poor world, life expectancy was around 30 years in all regions of the world.

      Life expectancy has increased rapidly since the Age of Enlightenment. In the early 19th century, life expectancy started to increase in the early industrialized countries while it stayed low in the rest of the world. Since 1900 the global average life expectancy has more than doubled and is now above 70 years. The inequality of life expectancy is still very large across and within countries. in 2019 the country with the lowest life expectancy is the Central African Republic with 53 years, in Japan life expectancy is 30 years longer.

          What drives improvements in life expectancy? Below we are looking at several aspects. One of the most important inputs to health is healthcare. Here we study cross-country evidence of the link between aggregate healthcare consumption and production, and health outcomes.

          One common way of measuring national healthcare consumption and production is to estimate aggregate expenditure on healthcare (typically expressed as a share of national income).
          
          This visualization shows the cross-country relationship between life expectancy at birth and healthcare expenditure per capita.
